         "3. Heat a 10-inch nonstick pan over medium heat and coat bottom of pan with 1 tsp butter. Just before adding eggs to the pan, whisk them until frothy (I used this hand cranked egg beater to speed up the process). Add half of the egg white mixture (enough to coat the pan).",
         "4. Immediately sprinkle 1/4 of cheese over the surface. Place spinach on one half and sauteed mushrooms and bacon on the other half. Use a spatula to fold omelet in half, being careful not to deflate your fluffy eggs. Slide onto a serving plate and sprinkle with 1/4 of cheese, then top with diced tomatoes and chives if desired. Repeat Steps 3 & 4 for second omelette."],
